Labels, Keywords, Terms, Topics: What it is to be a label
---------------------------------------------------------

It is our prerogative to label items however we wish with as many labels as we wish.

- keywords :: words that have descriptive meaning for us
- terms :: synonym of keywords; to remind us that we permit space-separated keywords
- tags :: another synonym
- topics :: not quite a synonym, being a set (possibly singleton) from the keywords
- decorations :: a label that you cannot describe in language. A song, an image, any other way of meaning. Please provide a uri that we might use the resource when displaying a decorated item. 


Tags are a set of terms, or a comma-separated string of terms. Something that is tagged, it has a nonblank string or nonempty set of terms.

                         #(apply (complement empty?) [(:tags %)])))
